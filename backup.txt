\section{Description of the data set}
Our choice of a data set landed upon '\textit{Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Prognostic)}' which is a data set consisting of records, each representing a data of patients with breast cancer.\\

Our initial choice of data set (\textit{Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)}) would have been of the same source with the difference being that it consists of diagnostic rather than prognostic data. The problem, however, was that it was not labelled as a data set on which we would be able to do regression on, so we scrapped this idea. Nonetheless this data set is also relevant, since oftentimes the two are used together.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.1.] \textbf{Reference to the data}\\
    We have obtained it from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (\textcolor{red}{REFERENCE NEEDED, link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+\%28Prognostic\%29}) \\
    \item[1.2.] \textbf{Previous analysis of the data}\\
    We have looked at two different papers that are relevant to the data set. \\

    \\O.L. Mangasarian, W.N. Street and W.H. Wolberg. Breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis via linear programming. Operations Research. This is an ongoing multi-disciplinary research that focuses on creating techniques built upon linear programming that train faster and yield more interpretable results for early detection of breast cancer, while maintaining accuracy. Such a technique demonstrated in the paper is called Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA). RSA uses linear programming to determine a linear combination of the input features which accurately predicts Time to Recur (TTR). They also used a classification procedure, Multisurface Method Tree (MSM-Tree), to separate benign from malignant samples. The method uses a linear programming model to iteratively place separating planes in the feature space of the examples of the data.\\\\
    W.H. Wolberg, W.N. Street, D.M. Heisey, and O.L. Mangasarian. Computerized breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis from fine needle aspirates. The goal of this paper was to determine the accuracy of image analysis in breast fine-needle aspirates(FNA). They used the data set for the same reason as they did in the paper above: they used MSM-Tree. The more interesting part is, however, how they extracted the 30 features we will be using: Xcyt was developed, which allows the user to input approximate locations of 10-20 nuclei, from which the rough outline of the cell nucleus is located. Once analyzed, the program calculates 10 features for each nucleus (more on that in section 2). \\
    \item[1.3.] \textbf{Classification and Regression}\\
    With this data set, we can set up a classification scheme which will help us classify whether the disease will recur (R) or not (N) following surgery based on the nuclei features (attr 4-33). \\\\
    Contrary to the above mentioned RSA procedure, with which they estimated the recurrence surface, we will set up our model of regression to estimate recurrence time (attr. no. 2=R) or disease-free time (attr. no. 2=N) based on the nuclei features (attr. 4-33). For this we will separate the data into two groups (based on recur class) and apply the model separately for each group.\\\\
    For evaluation, we will use K-fold cross validation technique, since the data set looks balanced in terms of classes we want to predict.
